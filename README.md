Zomato Data Exploration and Analysis with SQL (SQL SERVER)

Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. The idea of analysing the Zomato_dataset is to get the overview of what actutally is happening in their business. The dataset consists of four tables—goldusers_signup, users, sales, and product—detailing user signups, gold memberships, sales transactions, and product information.

To explore and analyze the provided Zomato data, I was working on various aspects related to user behavior, sales performance, and product popularity. Here are some key areas to explore along with example queries:

1. User Signup and Activity
Analyze the correlation between user signup dates and their activity in terms of sales.
Determine how many users have signed up for gold memberships and their subsequent purchase behavior.

2. Sales Analysis
Track sales trends over time.
Determine the most popular products.
Analyze sales before and after gold membership signup.

3. User Segmentation
Segment users based on their purchase frequency and value.

4. Product Performance
Compare the performance of different products in terms of sales and revenue.
Analyze trends in product popularity over time.

5. Gold Membership Impact
Assess the impact of gold membership on sales.
Compare purchase behavior of gold members vs. non-gold members.

By exploring these aspects, one can gain insights into user behavior, sales performance, and the effectiveness of gold memberships in driving sales. This analysis can help Zomato make informed decisions to enhance user engagement and optimize product offerings.
